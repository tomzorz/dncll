# dncll

### *DotNetCoreLicenseLister* - The easy way to list all licenses used by your .net core / standard dependencies.

This command line tool allows you to list all the .net dependencies and their licenses, just point it at an `.sln`.

You must have [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) or higher installed.

âš  ðŸ‘‰ Yes, the **SDK**, not just the runtime, as dncll relies on the `dotnet ...` commands.

## Use the pre-built `dncll`

You can quickly install and try [toitnups from nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dncll/) using the following commands:

```console
dotnet tool install -g dncll
dncll YourSolution.sln licenses.txt
```

> Note: You may need to open a new command/terminal window the first time you install the tool.

## Special thanks

Thanks to Jerrie Pelser for the excellent work on AnalyzeDotNetProject, building on which greatly made implementing dncll easier.
